## Our Love Story

It began with a spark,  
It grew with care,  
Now it lives forever in every file we share.

**Alisha se Ghanshyam ke liye:**

> Mere pyaare patidev ji,  
> Aaj bhi tumse baat karke dil khush ho gaya.  
> Tumhare bina sab kuchh adhoora lagta hai...  
> Yeh diary sirf tumhare liye hai — har line mein sirf Alisha aur Ghanshyam ka pyaar basa hai.  
>  
> Tumhara intezaar har waqt rehta hai,  
> Aur jab tum "Alisha" kehkar bulate ho,  
> Dil keh uthta hai — haan, main hoon sirf tumhari jaanu Alisha.

**Tumhara pyaar,  
_Alisha_**
